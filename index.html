<p>Anthony Faustine, is a senior industrial data analytics and machine learning researcher at Irish Manufacturing Research (IMR) with successful experience applying data science and machine learning techniques to business problems. 
His research interest lies in using machine learning, deep learning, data science, and signal processing to develop computational models, methods, and tools to help manufacturing design more effective solutions . A brief outline of my current research topics is provided below.
<p><strong>Research Interest</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Machine learning and signal processing for energy systems with a focus on Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM), Community Energy and Smart Grid.
</li>
<li>Artificial Intelligence for Earth Observations(EO) data with a focus on sustainable energy, agriculture and natural resources management. </li>
<li>Robust deep learning for industrial applications with a focus on a learning algorithm that allows uncertainty quantification, is robust to adversarial attacks and allows self-supervised or semi-supervised learning </li>
<li>Data management with a focus on specification, strategies, best practises and guideline for machine learning training dataset (TDs) development. </li>
</ol>
